# Hi, I’m Rawnak Tahmid 

I like learning things, building stuff, playing games, and trying new ideas. Sometimes I’m focused, sometimes I’m not—but I keep experimenting and developing naturally through my active works.

## What I’m Working On
- Learning coding and algorithms
- Testing new tools and software
- Building my own solutions for different problems
- Creating small, weird but unique projects

## What I Want to Improve
- Errors, bugs and broken code structure
- Better UI design
- logic and problem solving
- Building projects that actually work and help myself

## Latest Project
🔹 Study Anchor — A smart solution for moder distractions
